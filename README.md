## ➕ How to Add a New Tool Easily

Adding a new tool to Tool Verse is simple! You just need to update one file.

1.  Navigate to [src/tools/tools.js](src/tools/tools.js).
2.  Add a new tool object to the `tools` array. Each tool should have the following structure:

```javascript
{
  id: <unique_number>,
  name: "Tool Name",
  description: "A short description of what the tool does.",
  icon: "URL_TO_ICON_OR_PATH_TO_LOCAL_ASSET",
  category: "Category Name (e.g., Image, Video, Utility)",
  url: "https://the-tool-website.com"
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  name: "SVG Compressor",
  description: "Compress SVG files efficiently.",
  icon: "https://example.com/svg-icon.png",
  category: "Image",
  url: "https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/"
}
```

3. Save the file and that's it! The new tool will automatically appear on the home page.
